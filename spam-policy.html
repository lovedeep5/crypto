						<div class="pum-content popmake-content">
							<p>This statement applies to TheSoftware websites and services that display or link to this
								notice (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;). TheSoftware prohibits the use of the Services in any
								manner associated with the transmission, distribution or delivery of any unsolicited
								bulk or unsolicited commercial e-mail (&ldquo;Spam&rdquo;). You may not use any Services
								to send Spam. You also may not deliver Spam or cause Spam to be delivered to any of
								TheSoftware Services or customers.</p>
							<p>In addition, e-mail sent, or caused to be sent, to or through the Services may not:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Use or contain invalid or forged headers;</li>
								<li>Use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names;</li>
								<li>Employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in
									identifying the point of origin or the transmission path;</li>
								<li>Use other means of deceptive addressing;</li>
								<li>Use a third party&rsquo;s internet domain name, or be relayed from or through a
									third party&rsquo;s equipment, without permission of the third party;</li>
								<li>Contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain
									false or misleading content;</li>
								<li>Fail to comply with additional technical standards described below; or</li>
								<li>Otherwise violate the applicable Terms of Use for the Services.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>TheSoftware does not authorize the harvesting, mining or collection of e-mail addresses
								or other information from or through the Services. TheSoftware does not permit or
								authorize others to use the Services to collect, compile or obtain any information about
								TheSoftware&rsquo;s customers or subscribers, including but not limited to subscriber
								e-mail addresses, which are TheSoftware&rsquo;s confidential and proprietary
								information. Use of the Services is also subject to the applicable Privacy Statement and
								Terms of Use.</p>
							<p>TheSoftware does not permit or authorize any attempt to use the Services in a manner that
								could damage, disable, overburden or impair any aspect of any of the Services, or that
								could interfere with any other party&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of any Service.</p>
							<p>If TheSoftware believes that unauthorized or improper use is being made of any Service,
								it may, without notice, take such action as it, in its sole discretion, deems
								appropriate, including blocking messages from a particular internet domain, mail server
								or IP address. TheSoftware may immediately terminate any account on any Service which it
								determines, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any
								e-mail that violates this policy.</p>
							<p>Nothing in this policy is intended to grant any right to transmit or send e-mail to, or
								through, the Services. Failure to enforce this policy in every instance does not amount
								to a waiver of TheSoftware&rsquo;s rights.</p>
							<p>Unauthorized use of the Services in connection with the transmission of unsolicited
								e-mail, including the transmission of e-mail in violation of this policy, may result in
								civil, criminal, or administrative penalties against the sender and those assisting the
								sender.</p>
